# CMS-Hospital-Star-Rating-Prediction
I am analyzing what aspects of the patient experience are most predictive of CMS Hospital Star Ratings. Do some aspects of the patient experience have a cascade effect on other performance measures that CMS uses to make its star ratings? Should hospitals focus on a specific side of the patient experience to improve its rating?
